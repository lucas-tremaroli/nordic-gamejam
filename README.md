# 😴✨ The Prompted One ✨🌙  
*Dream big. Sleep harder.*

In this quirky 2D pixel RPG, your goal is simple: get **10 hours of sleep** 🛏️.  
But beware — light enemies lurk in the night, ready to jolt you awake! Your **health** is how *close you are to waking up*, so rest wisely. 😬🌌

💬 When morning comes, your friend checks in:  
*"Rough night?"*  
Based on how well you slept, she reacts — and then **you shape your destiny** by sharing your dreams. Want to be faster? Stronger? A cracker-throwing ninja? She listens. And next time you dream... those wishes come true. 🦸‍♂️✨

🤖 **Powered by GPT**, your conversations craft your stats and change the way you play.  
Every night is a new chance to snooze your way to greatness.
